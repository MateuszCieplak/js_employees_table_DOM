# Employees Table
[Live Demo](https://mateuszcieplak.github.io/js_employees_table_DOM/)  

The "Employees Table" project is a task management app where users can manage a list of employees in a table format. It includes features such as sorting the table, adding new employees via a form, and editing the table cells. The task focuses on implementing interactive features using vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

### Key features:
- **Table sorting**: The table rows can be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking on the table headers.
- **Row selection**: Clicking on a row will highlight it as selected.
- **Adding employees**: Users can add new employees to the table using a form with fields for name, position, office, age, and salary.
- **Data validation**: The form checks for valid data (e.g., name length, age range, etc.) before adding a new employee.
- **Notifications**: Success and error notifications are shown based on form validation results.

### Additional features:
- **Form inputs**: The form has required fields for each employee, including a select input for the office location and numerical inputs for age and salary.
- **Validation**: Notifications are shown if the form data is invalid, such as for an invalid name or age.
- **Inline editing**: Users can double-click on a table cell to replace the text with an input field. Changes are saved when the input loses focus or when the "Enter" key is pressed.
